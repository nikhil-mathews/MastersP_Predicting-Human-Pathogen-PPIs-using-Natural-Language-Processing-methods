# MastersP_Predicting-Human-Pathogen-PPIs-using-Natural-Language-Processing-methods
We use advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods available in deep learning and apply them to the proteins of Humans and Yersinia pestis. This is done by using the amino acid sequences of each protein pair that interact, or do not. We make no use of biological knowledge, and trust that the deep neural networks learns them implicitly during training to produce results that rival the reference research paper which makes extensive use of bio-chemical properties, both sequential and network related, to make their predictions.
